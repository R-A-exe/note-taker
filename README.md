## Description

This is a simple note application that allows users to add an keep track of their notes. The back end consists of a node server that routes requests to serve the webpages as well as save the data in a json file.
Note that since the herko server shuts down after 30 minutes of non-use, and given that notes are not saved in a database, the data is not persistent after a certain time.
